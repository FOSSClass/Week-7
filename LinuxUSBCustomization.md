### Linux USB Customization

Since I created my USB to have the **persistence** function, the customization
was a piece of cake. The USB remebers all the settings for you.

I *did* go to settings, changed the wallpaper, added an international keyboard
(good for those of you, who are bi/multi-lingual), adjusted what I want in the
dock and status bar and ran updates.

That way, every time I start my Linux USB with Persistence, it's always
**ready to go** and **_the same on any computer_** I use! :-)
